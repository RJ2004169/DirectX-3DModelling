# DirectX-3DModelling
3D scenes rendered using DirectX

The Japanese Temple in Forest scene has some forest sound effects implemented. There is also a movement script implemented to add the illusion of day time and night time to complement the sound effects, such as birds chirping in the morning. A particle system was also implemented to add the effect of snow in the wind, but is not fully functional at the moment
